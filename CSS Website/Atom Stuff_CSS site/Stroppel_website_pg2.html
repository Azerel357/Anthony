  <h1>The Story and Artwork</h1>
  <p>This is a back story that I came up for my currecnt character
  in D&D.</p>
  <h2>Story:</h2>
  <p>
      <span>He doesn't remember much about his past but Alahar knew for
      certain that he once was human. Kidnapped by an
    <br>ancient cult, the human was sacrificed by beiing thrown thtough
      a portal. Once through, the human realized that he
      <br>was now in the lower planes of exictance. All of a sudden, the space
      in front of him started to shift, materializing into
      <br>something else. What occupiped the space in front of him was
      the demon Zangor, a demon of excitment. Zangor had
      <br>become bored with the world, and wanted something new. Zangor foreced
      the human to make a pact and then sent him
      <br>back to the mortal plane. The human had now been reborn as a Teifling
      (look in the D&D Handbook on the homepage to
      <br>figure out that that means). Alahar the Wicked had been created,
      created for the single purpose to entertain the demon and
      <br>make the world a little more...interesting.</span>
